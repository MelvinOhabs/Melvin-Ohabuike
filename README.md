Hi there, I'm Melvin Ohabuike  

I’m a **Data Analyst & Aspiring Data Scientist** passionate about using data to tell stories, solve business problems, and inspire smarter decisions.  

💡 My work combines **business understanding**, **statistical thinking**, and **technical skill** — from SQL queries that dig out insights, to Python models that predict future outcomes, to Power BI dashboards that make data speak clearly.

### 🧠 What I Do
- 📊 **Data Analysis & Visualization** – uncover trends, performance metrics, and business insights  
- 🧮 **Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling** – build models that make data-driven forecasting simple  
- 🧠 **Business Intelligence** – turn data pipelines into dashboards that help leaders make better calls  
- 🧰 **Tools I Use:** Python, SQL, Power BI, Excel, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib  

🎵 Beyond Data  
When I’m not analyzing numbers, I’m probably **singing**, experimenting with new **AI ideas**, or writing about how data meets everyday life.  
I believe creativity and logic aren’t opposites — they’re a powerful combo.
